# Writing Unit Tests Lab

## Learning Goals

- Follow a test-driven development process for writing code
- Write a unit test using Jest

## Introduction

Time for some practice! In this lab, you'll write your own unit test and get it
to pass by following a test-driven development workflow.

As before, we'll use Jest as our test framework. We'll be writing the tests in
the `src/__tests__/utils.test.js` file and the application code in the
`src/utils.js` file.

Fork and clone this lesson, then run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Instructions

Our word game needs another feature. We'll give users double the amount of
points if their word is a
[palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome): a word that reads the
same forwards and backwards, like "mom" or "racecar".

You should implement a function `isPalindrome` by following test-driven
development that accepts a string as an argument and returns `true` if the
string is a palindrome, and false if it isn't.

Try testing some known use-cases first: `isPalindrome("racecar")` should return
`true` and `isPalindrome("car")` should return `false`.

Follow the same workflow we did in the previous lesson:

1. Understand the feature we're building
2. Translate the feature into a test specification
3. Write and implement code that passes the test
4. Clean up and refactor
5. Repeat!

Then, consider adding tests for some of these edge cases:

- Should return true for words that are a combination of uppercase and lowercase
  letters
- Should return false for an empty string
- **Bonus** Should throw an error if input has any non-alphabetic characters
  (hint: look into the [`.toThrow` Jest matcher][to-throw]). You can check if a
  word has only alphabetic characters with this regular expression code:
  `/^[A-Za-z]+$/.test(word)`
- **Bonus** Should throw an error if input that isn't a string (hint: look into
  the [`.toThrow` Jest matcher][to-throw])

Since you'll be _writing_ the tests, this lesson doesn't have any tests for you
to run to check your implementation. You can see both the completed tests and
the working solution in the [solution branch][solution] of this repository.
